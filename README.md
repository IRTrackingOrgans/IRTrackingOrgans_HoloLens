# IRTrackingOrgans_HoloLens
This GitHub project, named IRTrackingOrgans_HoloLens, offers a framework that leverages an adaptation of DINO-DLL by Hisham Iqbal & Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena for tracking phantom organs using the HoloLens 2.Direct link to the original DINO repository: https://github.com/HL2-DINO. Please cite their publication if this original version is used. 

This project includes a Unity (2019) project that enables the visualization of holographic 3D organ models and real-time tracking. For comprehensive support, please refer to the protocol guidelines provided by [JoVe, if published]. This project is based on the DINO-DLL, with some modifications that include support for 6.4mm diameter markers, integration of a selection menu, and transparency glider. It allows users to implement real-time tracking of phantom organs using the HoloLens 2.
